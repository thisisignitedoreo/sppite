sppline 2 alternative client that does not suck (as much)

_i got so bored hacking sppline 2 i decided to remake it from scratch_

## features
pros:
- allows selecting any portal 2 path (wink wink)

  i did not implement that, but, i did not see any
  mods with it
- has built in repository browser

- console interface (one might not say it is a con)

just run it, and see what it does.
